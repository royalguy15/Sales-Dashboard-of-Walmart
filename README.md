# Sales-Dashboard-of-Walmart
I design a sales report on the sales of Walmart USA by using of Microsoft Power BI. In this report I just analyse the following things to get the useful insights  Profit with respect to state  Profit with respect to Product Category  Sales with respect to Product Category  Sales with respect to Individual Products

Insights i have extracted
  1.Behalf of Profit v/s State
  2.Behalf of Profit v/s Category
  3.Behalf of Sales v/s Category
  4.Behalf of Sales v/s Individual product 

Overall output: -  We can derive that the Copier have the most profitable margin but it is not the product which have the maximum sales.  The most sold product is Chairs, but the profit margin of chairs has the less contribute towards the whole profit of the company.
The profit as well as the sales of Phones have almost same contribution. Papers are also be a hero product because it has a broad contribution in profit. Hence, California and Washington have more sales and profit.
